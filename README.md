## This repository will hold scripts to do data manipulation on MOTU tables generated by Mjolnir2.

### All the scripts are here: https://github.com/bioinfo-arctic/lynavleder/tree/main/scripts


#### The first one is for removing MOTUs with too many reads that came from BLANK samples.
> See the raw code [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bioinfo-arctic/lynavleder/main/scripts/remove_blanks.R)

#### The second one is for collapsing MOTU counts comming from the same taxa.
> See the raw code [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bioinfo-arctic/lynavleder/main/scripts/collapse_MOTU_counts.R)
