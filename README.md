# This repository will hold scripts to do data manipulation on MOTU tables generated by Mjolnir2.

### Check the scripts at: https://github.com/bioinfo-arctic/lynavleder/tree/main/scripts


#### The first one is for removing MOTUs with too many reads that came from BLANK samples.

#### The second one is for collapsing MOTU counts comming from the same taxa.
